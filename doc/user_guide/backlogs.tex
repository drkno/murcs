Managing Backlogs
\newline\newline
Backlogs can be easily maintained. Creating a backlog is the exact same process as creating any other type of model (via the File menu or the \'+\' button). Once you have opened the create window the only two things necessary for the creation of a backlog are the short name and the PO assigned to the backlog.
\newline
Adding a new story to a back log is easy. Simply select it from the story drop down (optionally give it a priority) and then press add. Prioritised stories will appear in the top of the table, ordered by their priority. Unprioritised stories will appear below them. To change the priority of a story simply select it and click on the up and down arrows to the side of the table. To remove a story simply click the X next to it.
