\section{Opening and Saving}

In order to maintain a file across multiple sessions using Murcs, persistent files may be saved and loaded.

When there is currently a file being viewed, its name will appear in the window title. If there are any unsaved changes, then a star will appear beside the name to indicate this. If you wish to save to a file, you may choose the "Save" option, which will overwrite the currently loaded file; or, you may choose the "Save As" option to create a new file. Example is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:file_menu}
