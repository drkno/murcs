\section{Troubleshooting}

If the application fails to open make sure you have the latest version of Java 8.

If the application ceases working, try restarting it. If that fails the developers can be contacted at s302g1@cosc.canterbury.ac.nz

Any bugs you would like to be fixed or features which you would like to see in the Murcs application, can be submitted using the built in feedback tool. This is available in the help menu or from the toolbar.
