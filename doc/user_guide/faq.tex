\faqentry{How do I make it work?}{Run it from the jar or compile it from the source code}

\faqentry{Can I make it generate random information to use as a starting base?}{Yes. Simply add the argument debug (with optional low, medium high afterwards) when you run the jar and it will automatically generate some information for you to use. This may be a bit more technical than most people will want. It is also not supported by us so if it goes wrong you can't blame us as you've been warned.}

\faqentry{What happens with my old projects?}{Currently they will not be loaded at all and a dialog will appear informing you to open it with the same version of the application that you created it with. We are working towards having support for all old version of .project files.}

\faqentry{
Are there any bugs?
}
{
Yes. The current bugs that we know of include: \newline \begin{itemize}
  \item People can not be unassigned from roles within teams, they can only be replaced.
  \item When a creation form detects an error in input it isn't always very obvious as sometimes it is hidden.
  \item Status reports are not pretty printed correctly.
\end{itemize}
