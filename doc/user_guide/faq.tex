{
There are several issues that we are aware of, they do not effect any of your data but they may cause things to look odd in the interface.\newline
These issues include:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the estimates workspace on the backlog editor if you repeatedly press undo or redo it causes issues where not all the stories load into the editor.
\item Navigation between different views does not keep track of the tab you were on in the Backlog, Team and Sprint editors.
\item Sometimes when you are navigating between items it will navigate back or forward twice. We are currently unsure why this happens.
\item The title above search results do not properly translate.
\end{itemize}
If you do find a bug or want to submit feedback, you can open the file menu and click feedback.
