Managing Skills
\newline\newline
Within Murcs it is very easy to manage skills. The main purpose of a skill is to provide an idea of what individual people are experienced in. Skills should be generic so that they can be added to multiple people. Some examples might be C\#, Java, Python, Talking.
\newline
When you wish to create a new skills simply go to the display list and select skills. Then following the same process as People, Teams etc. either click the add button in the bottom of the list or select File/New/Skill. Once you have done this a creation dialog will appear as shown Figure 22.

When you create a skill the only compulsory field is the short name, this should be along the lines of C\# or Java. The long name is optional and could be for example C Sharp. The description should just detail what the skill means in particular.
\newline\newline
When you've created a skill you can then edit it or delete it in a very similar way to other model items. Simply select the skill you want to edit or delete and then either edit it in the edit pane that appears or click the delete button at the bottom of the display list. If you are deleting the skill it will tell you where the skill is used and ask you to if you really want to remove it. If you do, the skill will also be removed from any people who have it. The only skills that are not deletable are PO and SM as these are necessary for Scrum.
