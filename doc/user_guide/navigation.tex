\section{Navigation}

There are various means of navigating through Murcs. The primary method is to select items from the side bar that you wish to inspect. If you wish to inspect a different item type, then the choice box above the side bar may be used to inspect different elements.

In order to conveniently go back to previously selected items, there are backward and forward buttons positioned in the toolbar that take the application to the previous page. If the undo feature is used then position information will be lost.

In addition to these, when an item is mentioned within another items editor, it exists as a hyperlink to that items editor window.

If you want to open something in a new tab, you can click on it whilst holding control.
