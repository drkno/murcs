\section{Tool Bar}

There is a tool bar for performing various frequently used commands (hahahahahaha as if anyone would ever actually use this, let alone frequently use it). These are listed below in their order from left to right in the given figure:

\begin{itemize}
\item Back - navigates back to the previous item
\item Forward - navigates forward to the next item
\item Revert - reverts the project back to it's original form
\item Undo - undoes the last change
\item Redo - redoes the last change
\item Add new item - you can specify the type in the drop down
\item Delete current item
\item Save the project
\item Save As
\item Open a new project
\item Generate a report - opens report generation window
\item Send feedback to the developers on bugs
\end{itemize}

It is also possible to hide sections of the toolbar. In order to do this right click on the toolbar (not on one of the buttons) and a context menu will appear with the sections of the toolbar that you can show and hide, as shown in the figure below.
